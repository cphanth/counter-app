# Creating a Counter App with a Mosh Tutorial

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I used a Mosh [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0&t=1899s) to get started on learning the React library.

## About the Project
The Counter App will be able to deploy similar functions that one would find in a simple e-commerce web application which includes having a navigation bar at the top which will also have a total items counter. Additionally, there are different items listed and the user can increment or decrement the desired quantity.

I learned about these things in order to creater the Counter App:
1. React components
2. Embedding expressions
3. Setting attributes
4. Rendering classes dynamically
5. Rendering lists
6. Conditional Rendering
7. Handling Events
8. Binding events handlers
9. Updating the state
10. What happens when the state changes
11. Passing event arguments
12. Composing components
13. Passing data to components
14. Passing children
15. Debugging React Apps
16. Props vs State
17. Raising and handling events
18. Updating the state
19. Single source of truth
20. Removing the local state
21. Multiple componenets in sync
22. Lifting the state up
23. Stateless functional components
24. Destructuring arguements
25. Lifecycle hooks
26. Mounting phase
27. Updating phase
28. Unmounting phase

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
